# Phase Development Plan: ClickUp Integration

This document outlines the structured approach for implementing the ClickUp integration feature through multiple development phases.

## Development Workflow Structure

### Phase Development Cycle

Each phase follows this exact sequence:

1. **Branch Setup**
   - Create or switch to feature branch: `feature/clickup-integration`
   - Ensure branch is up to date with main

2. **Status Review**
   - Review GitHub issue #3 for current status
   - Read any new comments or updates
   - Identify the next phase to work on
   - Confirm phase requirements and deliverables

3. **Development Work**
   - Implement all deliverables for the current phase
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
   - Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds
   - Run linting and formatting checks
   - Write or update tests as needed

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Test all new functionality manually
   - Verify no existing functionality is broken
   - Run full test suite: `npm test`
   - Run linting: `npm run lint`
   - Run build: `npm run build`

5. **Commit Changes**
   - Stage all changes: `git add .`
   - Create descriptive commit message following format:
     ```
     feat(clickup): implement phase N - <brief description>
     
     - Deliverable 1
     - Deliverable 2
     - Deliverable 3
     
     Phase N of 6 complete for ClickUp integration

     ```

6. **Update GitHub Issue**
   - Comment on issue #3 with phase completion status
   - Update checkboxes for completed deliverables
   - Note any discoveries, challenges, or changes
   - Indicate next phase to be worked on

7. **Phase Completion Verification**
   - Confirm all deliverables are complete
   - Verify commit is pushed to feature branch
   - Verify GitHub issue is updated
   - Only then is the phase considered complete

## Phase Overview

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Authentication üèóÔ∏è
**Branch:** `feature/clickup-integration`
**Focus:** Foundation - config system, HTTP client, basic command structure

### Phase 2: Basic Task Management ‚úÖ
**Focus:** Core functionality - create tasks, view tasks, user verification

### Phase 3: Enhanced Task Features üöÄ
**Focus:** User experience - interactive mode, advanced options, better feedback

### Phase 4: Advanced Querying & Display üìä
**Focus:** Data management - filtering, pagination, formatted display

### Phase 5: Workspace & List Management üè¢
**Focus:** Discovery - workspace navigation, quick filters, search

### Phase 6: Export & Advanced Features üì§
**Focus:** Polish - export formats, batch operations, comprehensive testing

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- All TypeScript code must compile without errors
- Follow existing code formatting (no blank lines in functions, guard clauses)
- Use existing utility patterns (Config class, Commander.js structure)
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include input validation

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for new utility functions
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Verify integration with existing config system
- Test CLI commands with various input combinations

### Security Requirements
- Store API tokens encrypted using existing encryption system
- Never log full API tokens (only first/last 4 characters)
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow secure credential handling practices

### Documentation Requirements
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Update help text for new commands
- Include usage examples in commit messages
- Document any configuration changes

## Git Workflow

### Branch Management
```bash
# Initial setup
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/clickup-integration

# During development
git add .
git commit -m "feat(clickup): implement phase N - description"
git push origin feature/clickup-integration

# Between phases
git checkout feature/clickup-integration
git pull origin feature/clickup-integration
```

### Commit Message Format
```
feat(clickup): implement phase N - brief description

Detailed description of what was implemented:
- Specific deliverable 1
- Specific deliverable 2
- Any notable implementation details

Phase N of 6 complete for ClickUp integration.
Addresses: #3

## GitHub Issue Management

### Phase Completion Update Format
```markdown
## Phase N Complete ‚úÖ

**Completed Deliverables:**
- [x] Deliverable 1 - brief note
- [x] Deliverable 2 - brief note
- [x] Deliverable 3 - brief note

**Implementation Notes:**
- Any important discoveries or decisions
- Changes from original plan
- Known issues or limitations

**Testing Status:**

- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration with existing features verified

**Next Phase:** Phase N+1 - Brief description
**Branch Status:** All changes committed to `feature/clickup-integration`
```

## Quality Gates

### Before Moving to Next Phase
- [ ] All deliverables for current phase complete
- [ ] Code compiles without errors (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] Manual testing confirms functionality works
- [ ] Changes committed to feature branch
- [ ] GitHub issue updated with phase status
- [ ] No existing functionality broken

### Before Final Merge
- [ ] All 6 phases complete
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of entire feature
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Security review complete

## Emergency Procedures

### If Development Gets Stuck
1. Document the issue in GitHub issue comments
2. Consider breaking the current phase into smaller sub-phases
3. Seek clarification on requirements
4. Consider alternative implementation approaches

### If Major Issues Discovered
1. Stop current development
2. Document the issue thoroughly
3. Assess impact on overall plan
4. Revise phase plan if necessary
5. Update GitHub issue with revised approach

## Success Metrics

### Per Phase
- All checkboxes in GitHub issue marked complete
- Commit exists on feature branch with phase deliverables
- No regression in existing functionality
- New functionality works as specified

### Overall Project
- All 6 phases complete
- Feature branch ready for merge
- GitHub issue shows 100% completion
- Full integration testing passes
- User documentation complete

---

**Remember:** Each phase must be fully complete (development + commit + issue update) before moving to the next phase. This ensures proper tracking and allows for easy rollback if needed.
